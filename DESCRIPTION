Description: 
    Provides a complete workflow for dose-response analysis from raw experimental
    data to publication-ready results. The package handles raw data processing,
    curve fitting, quality assessment, visualization, and result export for
    pharmacological and biological dose-response experiments. Key features include
    robust nonlinear regression using 3-parameter logistic models, automatic
    quality control metrics (Z-score, assay window, signal quality), professional
    visualization with multiple curve comparisons, and comprehensive reporting
    capabilities. Designed for high-throughput screening data, BRET assays, and
    general dose-response studies in drug discovery and molecular pharmacology.
