\usage{
batch_save_all_drc_plots(
  batch_drc_results,
  output_dir = "DRC_Plots",
  create_subfolders = TRUE,
  file_prefix = "DRC",
  file_extension = "png",
  overwrite = FALSE,
  plates_to_process = NULL,
  compounds_to_exclude = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE,
  show_legend = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{batch_drc_results}{A list containing the results of a batch DRC analysis.
The structure is expected to be a list of plates, where each plate contains
\code{drc_result$detailed_results}.}

\item{output_dir}{Character string. The main directory where plots will be saved.
Defaults to "DRC_Plots". The directory is created if it does not exist.}

\item{create_subfolders}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), creates a subfolder
for each plate within \code{output_dir}. If \code{FALSE}, all plots are saved
directly in \code{output_dir} with the plate name appended to the filename to prevent duplicates.}

\item{file_prefix}{Character string. A prefix added to the start of every filename.
Defaults to "DRC".}

\item{file_extension}{Character string. The file format/extension for the saved plots
(e.g., "png", "pdf", "svg", "tiff"). Defaults to "png".}

\item{overwrite}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, existing files with the same name will be overwritten.
If \code{FALSE} (default), existing files are skipped to save time.}

\item{plates_to_process}{Character vector (optional). A list of specific plate names
(keys in \code{batch_drc_results}) to process. If \code{NULL} (default), all plates are processed.}

\item{compounds_to_exclude}{Character vector (optional). A list of compound names
to exclude from plotting. Matches against the parsed compound name.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), displays a progress bar and
summary statistics (success/failure counts) in the console.}

\item{show_legend}{Logical. Whether to display the legend in the generated plots.
Defaults to \code{FALSE} for batch processing to save space or keep plots clean.
Can be overridden to \code{TRUE} if needed.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed directly to the underlying \code{plot_drc_batch} function
and/or the plot saving mechanism. Common useful arguments include:
\itemize{
\item \code{plot_width}: Width of the output image (in inches).
\item \code{plot_height}: Height of the output image (in inches).
\item \code{plot_dpi}: Resolution (e.g., 300).
\item \code{y_limits}: A numeric vector of length 2 (e.g., \code{c(0, 1.5)}).
\item \code{colors}: A vector of colors for the curves.
\item \code{show_IC50}: Logical, to display the IC50 value on the plot.
}}
}
\value{
An invisible list containing processing statistics:
\itemize{
\item \code{total}: Total number of plots attempted.
\item \code{success}: Number of successfully saved plots.
\item \code{failed}: Number of failed plots.
}
}
\description{
This function extracts all successful models from the provided \code{batch_drc_results} list,
parses the construct and compound names, sanitizes them for file creation, and saves
the corresponding plots. It supports creating subfolders per plate, filtering specific plates,
and excluding specific compounds.
}
\details{
Automatically iterates through a batch of Dose-Response Curve (DRC) analysis results,
generates plots for all valid construct-compound combinations, and saves them to a specified directory.

The function uses a robust sanitization method to ensure filenames do not contain
illegal characters (converting special characters to underscores).
It assumes the compound names in the results are formatted as "Construct | Compound"
or "Construct:Compound".
